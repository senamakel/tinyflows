//! SQLite persistence for scheduled jobs and their run history.
//!
//! The job/run *model* and next-run computation live in `tinyflows-schedule`;
//! this module is the storage half. Every function takes a
//! [`CronStoreOptions`] (database path, run-history cap, due-job batch size)
//! instead of a host config type, opens the database on demand and creates
//! or upgrades the schema idempotently, so a database written by an older
//! build opens unchanged (`schedule_schema_tests` pins the literal statements).
//!
//! Split by responsibility: [`schema`] owns row mapping and the
//! connection/migration setup, [`jobs`] owns job CRUD, and [`runs`] owns
//! run-history recording, output truncation, and history reads.
